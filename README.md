Genome Oriented Bioinorfmatics is a Seminar covering various Bioinformatics essentials/tools. 
This was a Group Project over 8 weeks together with Franziska Koller.

Main topics include:
1. Exon skipping  
2. Bam feature extraction  
3. Read simulation  
4. Differential Analysis  
5. GO enrichment  

Also includes a Capstone Project with a full [Report](https://github.com/AlexanderFastner/GenomeOrientedBioinformatics/blob/main/Blockteil_PaperGruppe7.pdf).

Project Prompt can be read here [Problem](https://github.com/AlexanderFastner/GenomeOrientedBioinformatics/tree/main/Block/READ.ME).
